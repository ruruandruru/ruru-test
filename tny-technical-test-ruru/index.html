              My romance with Hollywood memoirs began in my early twenties, when I was new to New York and would spend
              most Sunday afternoons wandering the aisles of the Strand bookstore. The “Film and Television” section was
              a kaleidoscope of out-of-print treasures, and I found that their contents were even more outrageous and
              entertaining than the hammy portraits on their covers. <br /><br />The Hollywood memoir is a perfect genre
              for summertime, when your mind is as gooey and malleable as a slice of American cheese, because it demands
              that you be willing to suspend your disbelief and indulge in dazzling lies. After all, that is what many
              Hollywood memoirs are—at least, it is what they were, before the modern era of public accountability and
              stroke-of-the-keyboard fact-checking. The sooner you accept that star stories are full of embellishments
              and omissions, invented quotes and one-sided recollections dictacted to patient ghostwriters, the sooner.

                My romance with Hollywood memoirs began in my early twenties, when I was new to New York and would spend
                most Sunday afternoons wandering the aisles of the Strand bookstore. The “Film and Television” section
                was a kaleidoscope of out-of-print treasures, and I found that their contents were even more outrageous
                and entertaining than the hammy portraits on their covers. <br /><br />The Hollywood memoir is a perfect
                genre for summertime, when your mind is as gooey and malleable as a slice of American cheese, because it
                demands that you be willing to suspend your disbelief and indulge in dazzling lies. After all, that is
                what many Hollywood memoirs are—at least, it is what they were, before the modern era of public
                accountability and stroke-of-the-keyboard fact-checking. The sooner you accept that star stories are
                full of embellishments and omissions, invented quotes and one-sided recollections dictacted to patient
                ghostwriters, the sooner you’ll come to appreciate them as the grand and eccentric performances that
                they are. <br /><br />Often, though, these books reveal as much as they hide. Autobiography was for a
                long time the best outlet stars had to talk openly about misogyny, racism, ageism, abuse, and other
                hideous aspects of life in Hollywood that the industry would rather ignore. The list compiled here is by
                no means exhaustive; it’s not a best-of but a starter pack of sorts. (Confession: I’ve left out men
                altogether, though many, including David Niven and Sammy Davis, Jr., have produced wonderful show-biz
                memoirs.) Some of the books here feel dated and, at times, maddening; at least one is completely
                bonkers. But all are dynamic artifacts that chart how the movie business has evolved over time and how
                far it still has to go. <br /><br />I should note that several of the books are out of print and require
                some hunting to find—but that’s half the fun. Go to a used bookstore and check the biography and memoir
                shelves. These exact Hollywood memoirs may not be there, but dozens of others will be. Lug a few home.
                And then, on a sweltering day, pick one up and give yourself over.
